## Our team social contract for this project

Reference: [Establishing Norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qquhoredhOu-DCmByEU-KDdJXP6XDL962fwYdl_lLaQ/)

### Roles
- Taskmaster
- Gitmaster
- Testmaster

### Daily process
- Morning stand-up immediately after algorithm practice (~9:20am) led by fellow or by the group if the fellow is unavailable
  - New roles are rotated
  - Stand-up prompts:
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - Any blockers?
    - What are you planning to do today?
- Pair programming will be assigned by the group in cases where an issue is particularly difficult or foundational
- When facing an issue, slack the group for help so as not to interrupt another’s train of thought
- Use judgement on when to ask for help but always ask for help if you have been blocked for 30 minutes or more
- Immediately prior to end of day (~5pm), check-in and discuss what work may be done after hours

### Workflow and Style
- Issues will be described, assigned, and tracked on Waffle implementing the Agile framework. Issues will be described using the user story.
- Every pull request will have at least one review. That reviewer may request a second review depending on the size and complexity of the pull request.
- Before submitting a pull request, team members should ensure their branch includes the most up to date changes from master.
- Git commit messages will use present tense.
- Everyone will use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and ensure pull requests are formatted according to its rules.

### Team expectations
- There is no group expectation to work on this project after hours. Any after hours work is at the individual’s discretion.
- We will assign tasks vertically and attempt to add feature through the entire stack
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Communicate how you are doing/feeling regularly, especially when having a bad day. This will help everyone be aware of everyone’s

### Issues
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  1. List out the pros / cons
  2. Discuss as a group
  3. Vote on it
  4. If the vote is split and the issue is big or foundational, escalate to a fellow or instructor
- If team members are frustrated with one another
  - Take a break
  - Bring in a fellow or instructor to help structure conversation
  - Discuss specific frustrations and talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.). Everyone should use ‘I’ statements when expressing their perspective
