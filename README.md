Daily process
Morning stand-up immediately after algorithm practice (~9:20am) led by fellow or by the group if the fellow is unavailable
New roles are rotated
Stand-up prompts:
What did you do yesterday?
Any blockers?
What are you planning to do today?
Pair programming will be assigned by the group in cases where an issue is particularly difficult or foundational
When facing an issue, slack the group for help so as not to interrupt another’s train of thought
Use judgement on when to ask for help but always ask for help if you have been blocked for 30 minutes or more
Immediately prior to end of day (~5pm), check-in and discuss what work may be done after hours
Workflow
?????????
Team expectations
There is no group expectation to work on this project after hours. Any after hours work is at the individual’s discretion.
We will assign tasks vertically and attempt to add feature through the entire stack
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Communicate how you are doing/feeling regularly, especially when having a bad day. This will help everyone be aware of everyone’s
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
List out the pros / cons
Discuss as a group
Vote on it
If the vote is split and the issue is big or foundational, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If team members are frustrated with one another
Take a break
Bring in a fellow or instructor to help structure conversation
Discuss specific frustrations and talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.). Everyone should use ‘I’ statements when expressing their perspective
